# **AAI Project: Train classifier for modified MNIST with unstable (spurious) features**

## **Description**

This project requires training an image classification model from scratch to classify a
preprocessed MNIST dataset.

The MNIST dataset has a training set of 60,000 samples and a test set of 10,000 samples. For this project, we have added some unstable (spurious) features to the original MNIST dataset. We need you to train a classifier that can filter out these spurious features to create a stable and robust

classifier.
